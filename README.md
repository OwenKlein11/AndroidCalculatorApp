# Android Calculator App (Project #2)

This project is a simple calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic, trigonometric, and logrithmic operations. Users can input numbers and operators to calculate results.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* [ ] The app displays the current input and result on the screen.
* [ ] Users can clear the current input and start new calculations.
* [ ] Users can toggle the sign of the current input.
* [ ] Users can convert the current input into a decimal percentage.
* [ ] Users can use trigonometirc operations on numbers including sin,cos and tan.
* [ ] Users can use logrithmic functions such as taking the log10 and ln of a number

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [ ] Users are prevented from dividing by zero.
* [ ] Numbers automatically round when off the screen
* [ ] Total is saved when orientation is changed, creating a seamless transition between horizontal and vertical orientation and vice verse.
* [ ] App contains a calulator icon.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of the implemented user stories:

## Notes

This portion of the app I dealt with a couple challeneges. The biggest being trying to keep the data when orientation changed. 
I tried multiple different ways and finally got it. It also was difficult creating a app icon, as I struggled with the layering and creating a vector.
