# Android Calculator App (Project #1)

This project is a simple calculator app that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users can input numbers and operators to calculate results.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* [ ] The app displays the current input and result on the screen.
* [ ] Users can clear the current input and start new calculations.
* [ ] Users can toggle the sign of the current input.
* [ ] Users can convert the current input into a decimal percentage.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [ ] Users are prevented from dividing by zero.
* [ ] Numbers automatically round when off the screen

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of the implemented user stories:

## Notes

During the development of this app, I encountered challenges related to handling user input and preventing division by zero. 
Additionally, ensuring smooth interaction between different buttons and operations required careful attention.
Lastly, since Android Studio, the Kotlin language, and XML is all very new to me, it took some time getting used to everything.
